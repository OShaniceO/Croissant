    <h1>Welcome to the Croissant Website</h1>
    <p>
        Croissants are a buttery, flaky, and delicious pastry that originated in Austria but became world-famous through French baking traditions. 
        Whether enjoyed plain or filled with chocolate, they're a perfect companion for breakfast or an afternoon snack.
